# Abstract
The main focus of this project is develop an Arabic poems topic modeling to predict the correct phase of poems that can correctly classify the topic.
# Data Description
The datase that will be used in this project has been downloaded from [here]( https://hci-lab.github.io/LearningMetersPoems/).the total number of terms is **1,831,770** poetic terms. Each terms is labeled by its **meter**, the poet who wrote it, and the **age** which it was written in. There are **22 meters**, **3701 poets and 11 ages**: Pre-Islamic, Islamic, Umayyad, Mamluk, Abbasid, Ayyubid, Ottoman, Andalusian, era between Umayyad and Abbasid, Fatimid, and finally the modern age.  It is important to note that the terms diacritic states are not consistent. This means that a term can carry full, semi diacritics, or it can carry nothing.
# Algorithms
1. Exploratory Data Analysis was done to the dataset.
  - **Cleaning**
      - Checked for nulls values.
      -  Checked for duplicates and remove.
      -  Chose a sample of 10,000 rows.
      -  Romoved unneeded columns.
  - **Natrual Langauge Processing**
       - Remove harakat, tashkeel and tatweel
       - Remove extra spaces and punctuations
       - Remove numbers
       - Replace [آ إ أ] with [ا]
       - Replace [ؤ] with [و]
       - Replace repeated letter with single letter like [وو]  ,[ىى],[اا].
       - Vectorization.
       - Tokenization.
       - Stemming.
       - Remove Stop Word.
2. Topic Modeling
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
- Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
- CorEx
3. Classification
- 7 classification models were built:
    - **XGBClassifier**
    - Gaussain Naive Bayes
    - Support vector machines (SVMs)
    - Random Forest
    - Multinomial Naive Bayes
    - Decision Tree
    - Logistic Regression
4. Clustering
- We calculates the inertia for 1 to 5 clusters.
- PCA to easily visualize clustering
- TSNE
